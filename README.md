 ## Welcome to the first page - The Bee Hive!
 ### It should look something like:
 ![Index Page](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/master/app/assets/images/index_page.jpg)

 ## The color palette that I am using for this project is:
 ![Color Palette](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/d5ea864106322a707ae7459c6d90ca818482a8c1/app/assets/images/color_palette.png)

 ### Code:
 ![Index Code](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/master/app/assets/images/index_code.png)
 ------
 From this page you will be able to see all the bee's that are part of hive.
 You'll also be able to select the bee that you wish to view.

 ![Selecting Bee](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/217b95613292bd077cb3c3f8c0e1773de1dbe325/app/assets/images/selecting_bee.png)

 ###Bee Page:
![Show Page](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/master/app/assets/images/show_bee_page.png)

In the top left of the page you will find a standard go back button.

![Go Back Button](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/d5ea864106322a707ae7459c6d90ca818482a8c1/app/assets/images/go_back_button.png)

Directly below the go back button you'll find the information on the bee. 
In this section you'll be able to change which comb the bee resides in, and see the information that is correlated between the comb and bee.

![Change Comb](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/d5ea864106322a707ae7459c6d90ca818482a8c1/app/assets/images/change_comb_button.png)

Moving down on the page you have the simulate week button. 

![Simulate Week](https://github.com/Micjoey/Dosis/blob/d5ea864106322a707ae7459c6d90ca818482a8c1/app/assets/images/simulate_week_button.png)

To simulate the week I somewhat differed from the README, and that is my apologies.
